### Project Details

This project is a prototype of the solution by the team shinigami for the NSUT hackathon Inspirathon.

### Problem Statement selected: Problem statement 1

You have recently completed engineering and when you went back to your village you were shocked to see how far it has been left behind as compared to the modern cities. You decided to bring a change in the way things work currently by using your knowledge and skills. You observe that women in your village are highly skilled artisans and capable of selling their products and teaching their skills in an international marketplace but due to lack of knowledge of technology, are left helpless. Develop a product to solve the same problem, Remember the following pain points: .\
• Village women have little or zero knowledge of technology. .\
• There is a language barrier between seller and customer .\
• There shouldn't be any cheating or harassment cases against the village women.

### How we deal with the problems.

Since we aim to build an application for women in rural areas with zero knowledge in technology therefore, we simplified the UI as much as possible and focused on the frontend.

### How this project can be extended in future 

India is a diverse country so there’s a huge scope of improvement. We can try to include multiple languages and dialects to involve as many rural women as we can and empower them.
